# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404 IT@JCU

By: Nishant_Rana  

This repo contains files used for a personal travel tracker. The tracker allows a user to track places they wish to visit and places
they have already visited. The program reads and writes a list of places in a text file.

The list will include: name of the place, the country it is located in, its priority using a numerical scale starting from 1 which is 
the highest priority and indicates whether that place has been visited (v) or unvisited (n).

A user can add a new place they have visited and mark places as visited, but they cannot change places from visited unvisited. The program will identify which countries are marked as visited and which aren't. This helpfully allows the user to select which country that they have already visited. The majority of input fields are coded in a manner to handle the general occurring exceptions. The user can quit the program which will summarise the total number of countries in his travel list. 
 
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code (over one week).

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).  

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?
> I began working on the travel tracker on the 30th of March this year and was able to complete the project 
> on the 9th of April. I used the WakaTime Extention and integrated it into Pycharm to calculate the total amount of time I put into this project. According to its records, I had spent 4 hours and 14 minutes on the 5th of April, 1 hour and 17 mins on the 6th of April, and the longest was on the 8th of April which lasted my entire day of 10 hours and 8 minutes. <a href="https://wakatime.com"><img src="https://wakatime.com/share/@d5b123ec-e5fe-4831-92cd-5a429cd99fcb/ad95bf6d-e065-4f64-919a-7d7dfc17f0c2.png" /></a>
2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?
> For the second assignment I plan to spend at least 4 hours a day on that assignment, using better programming constructs such as the switch case statement to minimise the use of the If Else statement. I will work on it in stages and add a lot more comments in my code to help another developer better understand my entire code. I will also create more functions and use classes effectively and last but not least I will not declare unnecessary variables.
