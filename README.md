# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker
Assignment 1 for CP1404 IT@JCU

By: Nishant_Rana  

This repo contains files used for a personal travel tracker. The tracker allows a user to track places they wish to visit and places
they have already visited. The program reads and writes a list of places in a text file.

The list will include: name of the place, the country it is located in, its priority using a numerical scale starting from 1 which is 
the highest priority and indicates whether that place has been visited (v) or unvisited (n).

A user can add a new place they have visited and mark places as visted, but they cannot change places form visited to unvisited.


At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace the `answer...` parts).  
Note: If you use the free WakaTime service on your own machine, you can track exactly how long you spent in code (over one week).

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.  
(`temp.csv` is to copy from in case you delete the contents of `places.csv` and want the original data back).
